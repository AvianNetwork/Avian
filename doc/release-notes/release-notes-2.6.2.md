How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the 
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Avian-Qt` (on Mac)
or `aviand`/`avian-qt` (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

Avian Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.11+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Avian Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
